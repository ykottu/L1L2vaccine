# L1L2vaccine
  
 The goal of regression is to create a model that can predict the values of a dependent (response) variable based on independent (explanatory or predictor) variables.  Here I build L1 and L2 regularized logistic regression models to classify vaccine receiving patients and evaluate the differences between these two regularization methods.  Please check out the jupyter NB or jasontdean.com for more details.
